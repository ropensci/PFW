## Overview

`PFW` is an R package designed for easy filtering, preparation, 
and management of data from [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/). 
Project FeederWatch is a community-driven project initiated in the 1980s
and run by the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/) and [Birds Canada](https://www.birdscanada.org/)
that compiles bird observations from thousands of "backyards, nature centers, 
community areas, and other locales" across North America. Project FeederWatch data is easy to access, 
but can often be tricky to work with; `PFW` serves to simplify and streamline the use of this data. 
Included in `PFW` are tools for taxonomic rollup, filtering by survey characteristics 
(species, state, etc.), merging in site metadata, and zerofilling for presence/absence modeling.

## Installation

`PFW` is still in development, but the development version can be installed from GitHub using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pak")

# Install this package
pak::pak("Visorbearer/PFW")
```

## Vignette

Background and details on using `PFW` to filter and process Project FeederWatch data are outlined in the [vignette](https://Visorbearer.github.io/PFW/articles/PFW.html).

## Citation

To cite `PFW` in publications, use:

> Maron, M. W. (2025). PFW: Tools for Filtering and Processing Data from Project FeederWatch.  
> R package version 0.0.1. https://github.com/Visorbearer/PFW

You can also run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
citation("PFW")
```

in R when `PFW` is loaded.

## Quick Start

This is a simple example which shows you how to do basic Project FeederWatch importing, filtering, zerofilling, and site data attachment.
Here, we'll load the example dataset and filter it for Song Sparrow, Dark-eyed Junco, and Spotted Towhee from Washington
and Oregon between 2022 and 2024 in November-February. Then, we'll zerofill that data and attach our site metadata:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(PFW)

# Load in the included example dataset
data <- pfw_example # If you were using your own selection of PFW data, 
                      # this would be pfw_import() instead.
# pfw_import() creates and defaults to "/data-raw" in a local directory, 
# but will accept a different filepath.

# Create a list of study species
species_list <- c("Song Sparrow", "Dark-eyed Junco", "Spotted Towhee")

# Create a list of study regions
region_list <- c("Washington", "Oregon")

# Filter data by species and region, from 2022–2024 during November-February
data_filtered <- pfw_filter(data,
  region = region_list,
  species = species_list,
  year = 2022:2024,
  month = 11:2, # pfw_date(), which is called within pfw_filter(), 
                # will appropriately wrap this around the end of the year.
  valid = TRUE, # TRUE by default
  rollup = TRUE # TRUE by default
)

# Output:
# 2 regions successfully filtered.
# Date filtering complete.
# Species roll-up complete. 36 ambiguous records removed.
# 3 species successfully filtered.
# Filtering complete. 23538 records remaining.

# View the filters that were applied
pfw_attr(data_filtered)

# Output:
# Filters applied to this dataset:
#
# - Filter type: region 
#  Values: Washington, Oregon 
#
# - Filter type: date 
#   year : 2022, 2023, 2024 
#   month : 11, 12, 1, 2 
#
# - Filter type: rollup 
#  Values: TRUE 
#
# - Filter type: valid 
#  Values: TRUE 
#
# - Filter type: species 
#  Values: song sparrow, dark-eyed junco, spotted towhee 

# Zerofill missing species/survey instance combos
data_zf <- pfw_zerofill(data_filtered)

# Attach site description metadata
# Replace "path/sitedata.csv" with the actual path to the downloaded file
data_full <- pfw_sitedata(data_zf, path = "path/sitedata.csv")
# If the file does not exist at that path, pfw_sitedata will
# download it there from the Project FeederWatch website.
# Alternatively, you can manually download the site description file from:
# https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/
```

## Acknowledgements

`PFW` was built from code originally developed for Project FeederWatch data preparation in Maron et al. (2025). 
While the function scripts in this package were created specifically for PFW, the code they are based on 
benefited greatly from examples and code snippets provided by Emma Greig, who passed away prior to the 
package's creation.
